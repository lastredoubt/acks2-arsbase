                        Users can pair the {{gameSystem.title}} with the "<b>OSRIC Compendium</b>" module (found in the
                        Foundry
                        Add-ons section), which provides a wealth of pre-made content such as character classes,
                        monsters,
                        spells, and magic items. Or they can create their own content and use the many variant rules
                        that
                        the
                        system provides, giving more options to players and game masters, adding flavor to the game and
                        the
                        adventure.
